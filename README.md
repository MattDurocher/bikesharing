# bikesharing
## Overview
This project saw us creating visualizations for our investors as we look to launch a bike-sharing company in Des Moines, Iowa. Our data was pulled from New York City with charts centered around trip duration, start/end point locations, and when trips are initialized.
## Results
Pictured below are screenshots with captions directly from my Tableau story (if you elect to view them online, the captions will still be there):

## Summary
Our data has presented us with a clear cut answer, these bikes are not going for long trips and are mostly used by people who are going to/from work or for whatever reason they need to ride in the morning and at night for. Because the bikes will be in Des Moines, another heavily populated area, it would make sense for use to put the bikes around or near both places of residency and places of business. If the bikes are accessible to people in those locations, they are more likely to use them as an alternative form of transportation.
